**Greener Landscapes in a Drier World: Identifying Drought-Tolerant Ornamental Plants in a Changing Climate for Western Oregon**

## Research Context

Climate change, including rising average global temperatures, prolonged drought, and irregular weather patterns, presents significant challenges to landscapes and their plant communities. Urban green spaces support mental health, mitigate urban heat island effects, and foster community cohesion. The objective of this project is to evaluate the drought tolerance and ecosystem services of several ornamental plant taxa. Findings from this study will provide data-driven recommendations to improve ecological management and guide the landscape industry in selecting climate-adapted species for the Pacific Northwest.
