# WaterWise_Trail

## Data Description 

To identify residential ornamental plant species capable of surviving and maintaining ecological value under minimal to no irrigation in the Pacific Northwest. This trial aims to inform species selection for climate-resilient landscapes. Seventeen commonly used landscape plant taxa have been established in replicated plots with minimal to no supplemental irrigation during summer months. Plant performance will be monitored throughout the growing season to assess drought tolerance and ecosystem service. 
 
Data Collected: 
- Soil Moisture (Volumetric Water Content): To track available water in the root zone and correlate with plant performance. 136 numerical data points in an Excel file.  
- Pollinator Observations: To assess the ecological support each species provides to pollinator communities under drought stress. 
- Plant Height and Width: To evaluate growth and vigor. Total of 136 numerical data points in an Excel file. 
- Canopy Coverage: TBD, but we are currently working on methodology.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Clear delegation of tasks is essential for maintaining accuracy, security, and proper stewardship of the project’s data. The chain of responsibility for the WaterWise Landscape Trial is as follows: 

**Principal Investigator (PI) – "El Partón"** 
- Owns the data and has final authority over publication, sharing, and authorship decisions. 
- Ensures compliance with Oregon State University (OSU) policies and funding agency requirements. 
- Oversees the overall integrity of the research project but is not involved in daily data handling.

**Graduate Research Assistant – "El Jefe"**

- Primary custodian of the data during the project lifecycle. 
- Responsible for data collection, organization, analysis, and initial storage. 
- Ensure all data is appropriately annotated with metadata and documented for future use. 
- Manages data backup schedules. 

**Undergraduate Research Assistant – "El Obrero"**

- Assists with physical data collection, initial data entry, and maintenance of research equipment. 
- Operates under the direction of the Graduate Research Assistant and receives training on data handling protocols. 
- Does not independently modify datasets without approval. 

## Data Standards and Metadata 

The WaterWise Landscape Trial complies with Oregon State University Policy 06-210, Research Data Access and Ownership. According to the policy: 

- The university retains the right to access research data. 
- The PI is responsible for maintaining data in accordance with institutional and sponsor requirements. 
- A formal DMP is required for projects involving publicly shared data. 

Furthermore, given the project’s Extension focus, final results and datasets will be made publicly available in compliance with open-access policies. Summarized datasets and supporting materials will be disseminated through Extension publications and public presentations targeted primarily at Oregonians. 

## Storage and Security

To minimize the risk of data loss, a multi-tiered storage strategy will be implemented: 

**Primary Storage**:
All datasets will be stored in OSU’s official cloud-based content management platform, **Box**, ensuring secure, centralized access for the research team. 

**Secondary Backup**: 
Data will be backed up weekly to a password-protected external hard drive (e.g., USB flash drive) maintained by the Graduate Research Assistant. 

**Tertiary Backup**: 
A third backup will be maintained on a secure personal computer belonging to the Graduate Research Assistant. This device will also be encrypted and regularly updated. 


## Access and data sharing

See **Storage and Security** section -> **Primary Storage**

## Archiving and preservation 

Data files will use a standardized naming convention to prevent overwriting or data loss during edits.
